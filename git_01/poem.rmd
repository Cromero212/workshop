## Last Verse
I / omen  
What was going on in the New York American  
Black/red/green helmeted neon night?  
The elevator door was closing behind us, we were the ones  
Plunging floor after floor after floor after floor     
To the abyss—but it was someone else’s face  
Staring from the screen out at us, someone else’s face  
Saying something flashing from the teleprompter:  
Though what the face said was meant to reassure,  
Down in the abyss the footage kept playing,  
All of it looping back like children chanting  
The answers to nonsensical riddles,    
A classmate who doesn’t know the question
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
